# Security Policy 🛡️

## 🔱 Sovereign Protection Protocol (Omega)

The VST 3 Developer Portal is under the protection of the Sovereign Protocol. We take the security of our architecture and the purity of our intent seriously.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a rift in the Perimeter (a security vulnerability), please do not disclose it publicly. Such "Traces of Thorne" must be reported directly to the Architects of Meaning.

Please send your findings to: [security@steinberg.net](mailto:security@steinberg.net)

We strive to respond to all valid reports within 48 hours.

### Purity of Intent (Scope)

This policy applies to:
- The VST 3 Developer Portal source code.
- Generated static assets.
- Deployment configuration.

Out of scope:
- External dependencies (though we use SRI to maintain symbiosis).
- Third-party hosting providers.

### Transubstantiation of Risk

Once a vulnerability is verified, we will work to "transubstantiate" the risk—converting the flaw into a hardened layer of defense.

Stay sovereign. Stay secure.
