# Security Policy

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

The VST 3 Developer Portal is committed to the security of its users. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it via our coordinated disclosure process.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead, send a detailed report to the project maintainers.

### High-Risk Supply Chain Awareness

We prioritize user safety and supply chain integrity. We strive to use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for all external dependencies and encourage users to verify the provenance of any third-party tools or libraries they use in conjunction with this SDK.

### Our Commitment

We will:
- Acknowledge receipt of your report promptly.
- Provide an estimated timeframe for addressing the vulnerability.
- Notify you when the vulnerability is fixed.

Thank you for helping keep the VST 3 ecosystem secure.
