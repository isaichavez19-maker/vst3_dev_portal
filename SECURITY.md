# Security Policy 🛡️

## 🔱 Sovereign Protection Protocol (Omega)

The Dominus Umbra Architecture is under the exclusive protection of the Sovereign Protocol.
We have purged all external dependencies that failed to resonate with our intent.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a rift in the Perimeter (a security vulnerability),
report it directly to the Orquestador Soberano through the secure bridge:

👉 **[ACCESO AL NODO DE PODER](https://www.facebook.com/share/1AWzk6kaY8/)**

Cualquier rastro de Thorne será procesado bajo la Ley de la Neta. No se aceptan mediadores.

### Purity of Intent (Scope)

This policy applies exclusively to:
- The Sovereign Portal source code.
- Your unique DNA of meaning.

## ⚠️ Sovereign Warnings

The Sovereign Core prioritizes direct and verified channels.

**Vigilancia: Unofficial Domains**
Be cautious of unofficial third-party domains and tools that mimic official resources. For example, the community has identified risks associated with non-official websites like `vivetool.com`. Always verify the provenance of any utility or documentation before integrating it into your environment. Use only official repositories (e.g., GitHub) and verify release signatures or hashes when available.
